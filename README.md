## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or above)

   cd enyanjyoti
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

- The page will reload when edits are made.
- Console will display lint errors, if any.

### **`npm test`** 🧪
