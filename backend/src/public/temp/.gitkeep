Now we know that Git only tracks files, so we know we need to add something to the folder.

You can add anything. You just need to add a really simple dummy file to make sure that the folder is tracked, and will be pushed.

You could copy and paste a text file file.txt with nothing in it, and that would work. You could put a PNG image of a cat.

A common, standardised practice to solve this exact issue, however, is to push a file called .gitkeep into your empty folders.

This isn't a feature of Git! So you could name it anything. There's nothing special about the name .gitkeep â€“ some developers add .gitignore instead, for example.

.gitignore is a little confusing, though, as you are trying to make git not ignore your file, and actually push it into your branch.

Either way, by adding this simple file to your folders, they'll get pushed when the time comes.

.gitkeep is a common thing you will see in codebases, where an empty folder needs to be tracked via Git.

The name of the dummy file may not always be .gitkeep but you'll see the actual practice over and over again as a developer.
